# ENERGY-EFFICIENCY-OPTIMIZATION-NM
# 🔋 Energy Efficiency Optimization

This project demonstrates a simple approach to **energy efficiency optimization** using pure Python, without any external libraries. It simulates an energy cost function based on indoor temperature and finds the optimal temperature that minimizes energy usage.

## 🧠 Introduction

Energy efficiency is critical for reducing operational costs and environmental impact in homes, offices, and industries. This project explores a basic method to determine the optimal indoor temperature for minimizing energy consumption, using mathematical modeling and brute-force search.

---

## 📄 Project Description

The system models a simplified energy cost function where the energy consumption increases when the temperature deviates from an optimal point (e.g. 22°C). The script calculates energy costs over a temperature range and determines the best temperature setting for minimal consumption.

## 📊 Visualization

While this simple version doesn’t use charts, here’s what the energy cost function looks like:

The energy cost is lowest at 22°C and increases as the temperature moves away.

## 🎯 Objective

- Simulate a basic energy cost model.
- Use pure Python to find the most energy-efficient indoor temperature.
- Provide a foundation that can be extended with real-world data and machine learning.

## 📚 Data Source

This example does **not** use external datasets. Instead, it uses a **simulated energy cost function**:

```python
energy_cost(temp) = (temp - 22)^2 + 5
In real applications, this can be replaced with sensor data or historical energy consumption logs.

🛠️ Technology Used
Python (no external libraries required)

Simple brute-force search

Works in any Python environment (Python 3.x)

▶️ How to Run the Code
Open any text editor and paste the code into a file called energy_optimizer.py.

Make sure Python 3 is installed.

Run the script using the command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
python energy_optimizer.py
You will see output similar to:

✅ Conclusion
This project presents a beginner-friendly and pure Python implementation for optimizing energy usage. It demonstrates how a simple mathematical model can be used to improve efficiency without the need for complex libraries or datasets. You can extend this by:

Incorporating real-time sensor data

Adding more variables (humidity, occupancy)

Applying machine learning models for prediction
